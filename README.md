# Practical-ML-For-Cybersecurity

# Overview
This repository contains a collection of projects that apply machine learning techniques to solve various cybersecurity challenges. The projects demonstrate how ML models can be used to detect threats, analyze malware, identify network intrusions, and perform other security-related tasks. Each project focuses on a specific problem in cybersecurity and leverages machine learning algorithms to provide a data-driven solution.

This outline highlights the practical application of machine learning in cybersecurity, helping showcase how the repository's projects contribute to detecting and preventing security threats. Adjust the project descriptions and technologies to reflect your actual work.

This repository shows more than twenty different practical exercises applied to real data sets to solve different problems within the field of information security through the application of Machine Learning techniques.

The exercises are part of the UDEMY course [**_Machine Learning from scratch: Real projects in Python 3._**](https://www.udemy.com/course/machine-learning-desde-cero/?referralCode=008FE3DCE6F9C5EDA6DC)

This 30-hour video course presents the fundamentals of Machine Learning from an eminently practical perspective. Each of the practical exercises presented in this repository is based on a set of theoretical and mathematical foundations that are presented throughout the course, starting with the explanation of the basic concepts, accessible to anyone, and building intuitions up to the presentation of complex techniques.

# Installation

To run these exercises, it is recommended to install the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) distribution, which includes all the necessary utilities.

Once Anaconda is installed, the exercises can be downloaded using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/shramos/practical-ml-for-cybersecurity.git
```

The downloaded files can be viewed and run using the [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org) utility included in Anaconda.

**IMPORTANT:** For those who do not have a suitable environment for installing Anaconda, they can run the exercises in the Google cloud: [Google Colaboratory](.research.google.com) by clicking on the link that appears at the beginning of all the exercises:
